### **For the bamazonCustomer.js page**

Immediately when you run bamazonCustomer.js, the list of inventory is shown
![start](https://github.com/SleepyJen/myAmazon/blob/master/images/1.png)

At the bottom, the user is asked to provide the item code of the item they want to purchase. For this example, I chose item number 4. After clicking enter, the item chosen is shown to confirm if this was the right item. Then the user is asked how many of this item they wanted to purchase. 
![Item and quantity](https://github.com/SleepyJen/myAmazon/blob/master/images/2.png)

Once the user enters the quantity in which they would like to purchase and click enter, the item is shown along with the quantity and the total price of the purchase. After the purchase is finished, the user is asked if they would like to continue shopping, or exit the program.

If the user clicks "Continue Shopping", the new and updated inventory table is shown.
